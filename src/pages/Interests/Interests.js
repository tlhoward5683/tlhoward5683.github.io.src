            Believe it or not, I don't spend all of my time coding.  I know, shocking!<br /><br />
            
            I grew up in Austin, Texas, and I love all of the outdoorsy stuff the area has to offer from hiking the 
            numerous trials to kayaking on the lake.<br /><br />

            I have a soft spot for animals, whether they be neighborhood stray cats or squirrels.  If it's hungry, Imma 
            feed it.<br /><br />

            I also enjoy some flower gardening now and then...when it's not too hot or too cold out.<br /><br />

            So there ya go.  That about sums me up!
